By framing a situation as having only two possible paths (typically one desirable and one undesirable), it restricts thinking, manufactures artificial urgency, and prevents consideration of more balanced approaches or creative solutions that might better address the actual complexity of the situation.",

Rather than using criticism or negative messaging, it works by creating positive associations and feelings that encourage acceptance of ideas, products, or people.",
  "core_mechanism": "It works by leveraging our natural responsiveness to positive reinforcement and validation. By creating positive emotional states through praise, encouragement, or enthusiastic statements, affirmation can lower critical thinking barriers and increase receptivity to persuasion. The good feeling generated by affirmation often transfers to the associated message, person, or product, increasing acceptance and creating a sense of connection or alignment with the affirmer.",
