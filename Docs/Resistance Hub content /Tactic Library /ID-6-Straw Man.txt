# Tactic Library: Straw Man

**(Tactic ID: 6)**

---

### **Tactic Detail View**

* **Clear Definition:** This tactic involves misrepresenting an opponent's position, argument, or belief in a way that makes it easier to attack or dismiss. The distorted version (the "straw man") is then refuted instead of addressing the actual position the person holds.
* **Core Mechanism:** It works by shifting the focus from the original argument to a weaker, exaggerated, or oversimplified version that is easier to criticize. By attacking this distorted version, it creates the illusion of having defeated the original position while actually avoiding engagement with its strongest points. This can make opponents appear unreasonable or extreme while positioning oneself as reasonable by comparison.

### **Intent Spectrum Explained**

* **Legitimate Use:**
    * **Description:** Summarizing complex arguments in good faith for clarity or time constraints while preserving core meaning. Addressing common misinterpretations of a position to clarify what is and isn't being claimed. Focusing on specific parts of an argument for deeper analysis while acknowledging the broader context.
    * **Example:** A physics teacher simplifying an expert's view for students while acknowledging the simplification. *"Professor Zhang's complete theory involves complex quantum calculations, but the core principle we need to understand today is that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously."* [Cite: 1.1]

* **Borderline Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Oversimplifying nuanced positions to their weakest form. Focusing exclusively on extreme examples while ignoring moderate ones. Combining multiple opponents' weakest arguments as if they represent a single cohesive position. Exaggerating implications of an argument beyond what was stated or intended.
    * **Example:** A political commentator characterizing an opponent's call for police reform as more extreme than it is. *"My opponent wants to 'reimagine policing,' which is really just a fancy way of saying they want to leave our neighborhoods completely unprotected from criminals."* [Cite: 1.2]

* **Blatant Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Deliberately fabricating positions that were never stated or implied. Attributing views to opponents that are opposite of what they actually believe. Creating and attacking extreme caricatures designed to alienate the audience from the opponent's actual views. Using intentional misrepresentation to damage credibility or incite outrage.
    * **Example:** A commentator completely fabricating an opponent's position on immigration. *"Scientists who question our climate models are basically saying they want children to die in floods and hurricanes. They're claiming climate change is entirely made up, when we can all see the evidence with our own eyes."* [Cite: 1.3]

### **Common Scenarios**

* **Political Debates and Commentary:** Candidates or pundits misrepresenting opponents' policy positions to make them sound more extreme or unreasonable (e.g., "My opponent wants open borders" when they actually support immigration reform). [Cite: 2.1]
* **Religious or Philosophical Discussions:** Simplifying complex theological or philosophical positions to make them easier to dismiss (e.g., reducing religious beliefs to simplistic caricatures). [Cite: 2.2]
* **Media Coverage:** News outlets presenting oversimplified versions of complex issues or movements, focusing on extreme examples rather than mainstream positions (e.g., characterizing entire social movements by their most radical elements). [Cite: 2.3]
* **Social Media Arguments:** Users responding to exaggerated versions of others' posts or comments rather than what was actually stated (e.g., "So what you're saying is..." followed by an extreme interpretation). [Cite: 2.4]
* **Scientific Discourse:** Misrepresenting scientific positions to make them appear less credible or more controversial than they actually are (e.g., "Scientists claim they can predict the exact temperature in 100 years" when the actual claim involves range projections with stated uncertainty).

### **Related Cognitive Biases**

* **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms pre-existing beliefs. This makes people receptive to straw man arguments that align with their existing views about an opposing group. [Cite: 3.1]
* **Naive Realism:** The tendency to believe that we see reality objectively and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, irrational, or biased. This makes it easier to accept oversimplified versions of opponents' views. [Cite: 3.2]
* **Illusion of Asymmetric Insight:** The belief that we know others better than they know themselves, making us prone to accepting oversimplified characterizations of others' beliefs. [Cite: 3.3]
* **Group Attribution Error:** The tendency to assume that individual members of a group share the same beliefs or characteristics. This facilitates generalizing from extreme examples to entire groups. [Cite: 3.4]

### **"How to Spot It" Checklist**

* [_] Does the characterization use extreme language or absolutes to describe an opponent's position?
* [_] Are qualifiers, nuances, or conditions from the original position omitted in the representation?
* [_] Would proponents of the original position recognize or accept this characterization of their views?
* [_] Does the representation focus only on the weakest or most extreme aspects of a position?
* [_] Are phrases like "So you're saying..." or "What this really means..." followed by an oversimplified version of the position?
* [_] Is the response addressing the strongest or most central points of the original argument?
* [_] Are specific quotes from the original position provided in context, or are claims about the position made without direct evidence?

### **Detailed Resistance Strategies**

1. **Request Direct Quotations:**
   * When someone characterizes another's position, ask for direct quotes or specific references rather than accepting paraphrases.
   * The question "Where exactly did they say that?" can reveal whether a position is being accurately represented. [Cite: 4.1]

2. **Apply the Principle of Charity:**
   * Deliberately interpret others' arguments in their strongest, most reasonable form rather than their weakest.
   * Ask yourself: "What is the most reasonable interpretation of what they're trying to say?" [Cite: 4.2]

3. **Check Primary Sources:**
   * Whenever possible, go to original speeches, papers, or complete statements rather than relying on others' characterizations.
   * Be particularly cautious of clips, quotes, or summaries that seem designed to provoke outrage. [Cite: 4.3]

4. **Practice "Steelmanning":**
   * Instead of attacking the weakest version of an opponent's argument (strawmanning), practice constructing the strongest possible version of their position before responding.
   * This involves actively looking for the best interpretation and addressing the core of their actual beliefs. [Cite: 4.4]

5. **Check Your Emotional Response:**
   * If a characterized position seems obviously absurd or generates immediate strong emotion, this may be a signal that it's been oversimplified or distorted.
   * Ask: "Would an intelligent, well-meaning person actually hold this view as presented?" [Cite: 4.5]

6. **Look for Acknowledgment of Complexity:**
   * Be wary when complex positions are reduced to simple, absolute statements without qualifiers or nuance.
   * Most sophisticated positions include conditions, exceptions, and acknowledgment of tradeoffs. [Cite: 4.6]

7. **Invite Clarification:**
   * When discussing contentious issues, periodically summarize others' positions and ask if your understanding is correct.
   * Create opportunities for people to clarify their actual views rather than assuming you understand them completely. [Cite: 4.7]
