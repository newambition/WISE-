  "name": "Bandwagon Effect",
  "definition": "The bandwagon effect is a tactic that encourages people to think or act in a certain way because many others are supposedly doing so. It leverages social proof to suggest that widespread adoption or belief validates an idea, product, or behavior, implying that not joining the majority means missing out or being wrong.",
  "core_mechanism": "It works by exploiting our natural desire to conform and belong. By highlighting or exaggerating the popularity of something, this tactic triggers social conformity pressures and fear of exclusion. The implication that 'everyone' is doing, thinking, or buying something bypasses critical evaluation, replacing individual judgment with group behavior as the decision-making criterion.",
  "intent_spectrum": {
    "legitimate": {
      "description": "Accurately reporting genuine popularity or consensus to provide useful social information. Highlighting authentic trends or majorities when relevant to decision-making. Transparently sharing adoption rates or popularity metrics to help people make informed choices.",
      "example": "A health official noting, 'Over 90% of doctors recommend vaccination, based on extensive safety data and clinical trials. While each person should consult their physician about their specific situation, this strong medical consensus reflects decades of research results.'"
    },
    "borderline": {
      "description": "Emphasizing popularity while downplaying potential drawbacks. Framing popularity as inherently meaningful without explaining why. Using ambiguous terms like 'fastest-growing' or 'most popular' without specific metrics. Implying social consequences for non-adoption without explicit threats.",
      "example": "A tech company marketing: 'Join the millions switching to our app. Don't get left behind using outdated tools when everyone is experiencing our revolutionary platform. Our user base grew 200% last quarter!' (Not mentioning that growth was from a small base or that retention rates are low.)"
    },
    "blatant": {
      "description": "Fabricating or significantly exaggerating popularity claims. Creating false urgency around joining a supposed trend. Explicitly suggesting that non-conformity will result in rejection or ridicule. Using manufactured consensus to substitute for evidence of quality or effectiveness.",
      "example": "A social media influencer claiming: 'EVERYONE is talking about this investment opportunity! I've never seen anything like it - literally all the smart money is pouring in. If you're not buying now, you'll be the only one missing out on these guaranteed returns. My followers who joined last week are already seeing MASSIVE profits!'"
