# Tactic Library: Argument by Assertion

**(Tactic ID: 4)**

---

### **Tactic Detail View**

* **Clear Definition:** This tactic involves presenting claims, opinions, or conclusions as established facts without providing adequate supporting evidence, reasoning, or acknowledgment of uncertainty. The speaker repeatedly states something as true, often with confidence and authority, regardless of its actual verifiability.
* **Core Mechanism:** It works by exploiting the cognitive tendency to accept information presented confidently, especially when repeated. By bypassing the normal burden of proof, assertions can shape beliefs through familiarity and repetition rather than through substantive argumentation. When delivered by perceived authorities or trusted sources, or when aligned with existing beliefs, assertions are particularly effective at appearing factual without meeting evidentiary standards.

### **Intent Spectrum Explained**

* **Legitimate Use:**
    * **Description:** Stating widely accepted facts or well-established knowledge without extensive citation, particularly when evidence is readily available or commonly understood. Presenting expert consensus in appropriate contexts while remaining open to providing supporting evidence if questioned.
    * **Example:** A meteorologist stating "Climate change is causing sea levels to rise" when this reflects overwhelming scientific consensus and the context doesn't require detailed citation of studies. *"Based on decades of measurements, we know that global sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate due to climate change."* [Cite: 1.1]

* **Borderline Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Presenting contested claims, interpretations, or predictions as settled facts. Overstating certainty on matters that have some evidence but remain debated. Using confident language to mask limitations in data or conclusions. Repeatedly asserting claims while providing minimal or selective evidence.
    * **Example:** A financial advisor confidently predicting market movements as certainties rather than probabilities. *"The market WILL crash this summer. This is absolutely going to happen. The signs are unmistakable. Smart investors are already pulling out."* [Cite: 1.2]

* **Blatant Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Repeatedly stating false or highly dubious claims as unquestionable facts. Using circular reasoning where the assertion itself is treated as evidence of its truth. Responding to requests for evidence with ridicule, attacks, or further assertions. Fabricating false consensus or expertise to support assertions.
    * **Example:** A supplement seller repeatedly claiming, without scientific evidence, that their product cures multiple diseases. *"This formula cures cancer. I know this for a fact. Thousands have been cured. The medical establishment doesn't want you to know this truth. Anyone questioning this is simply ignorant of the facts."* [Cite: 1.3]

### **Common Scenarios**

* **Political Discourse:** Politicians or commentators making definitive statements about complex policy outcomes, opponents' motives, or causal relationships (e.g., "This tax plan will definitely create millions of jobs"). [Cite: 2.1]
* **Media and Punditry:** News commentators or analysts presenting opinions or predictions as established facts (e.g., "This policy will destroy the economy," rather than "This policy could negatively impact economic growth"). [Cite: 2.2]
* **Marketing and Advertising:** Product claims presented as definitive without adequate substantiation (e.g., "This is the most effective treatment available" without comparative studies). [Cite: 2.3]
* **Social Media:** Users confidently sharing unverified information or personal interpretations as factual (e.g., "Studies prove that X causes Y" without citing specific research).
* **Pseudoscience:** Presenting fringe theories or contradicted claims as scientifically established (e.g., "Science has proven that conventional medicine suppresses the immune system"). [Cite: 2.4]

### **Related Cognitive Biases**

* **Illusory Truth Effect:** The tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure. Simply encountering an assertion multiple times increases its perceived truth, even if it was initially identified as false. [Cite: 3.1]
* **Authority Bias:** The tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinions of an authority figure and be more influenced by their assertions. This makes assertions from perceived experts or leaders particularly persuasive regardless of their actual veracity. [Cite: 3.2]
* **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms one's pre-existing beliefs. This makes us more likely to accept assertions that align with what we already believe without demanding evidence. [Cite: 3.3]
* **Cognitive Ease:** The tendency to prefer information that is easier to process. Simple, confident assertions require less cognitive effort than evaluating complex evidence, making them more likely to be accepted, especially when mental resources are limited. [Cite: 3.4]

### **"How to Spot It" Checklist**

* [_] Is a claim presented as an absolute fact without qualification or uncertainty?
* [_] Does the speaker use phrases like "everyone knows," "it's obvious," or "clearly" instead of providing evidence?
* [_] When asked for evidence, does the person simply repeat the assertion or redirect the conversation?
* [_] Are complex issues presented with unrealistic certainty or simplicity?
* [_] Is the same claim repeated multiple times with increasing confidence but no additional evidence?
* [_] Does the speaker respond to challenges with dismissal or by questioning the challenger's intelligence or motives?
* [_] Are you accepting the claim primarily because it's stated confidently or because it aligns with what you want to believe?

### **Detailed Resistance Strategies**

1. **Explicitly Separate Claims from Evidence:**
   * When encountering an assertion, mentally categorize it as "claim" rather than "fact" until supporting evidence is provided.
   * Practice asking yourself: "How does the speaker know this? What specific evidence supports this claim?" [Cite: 4.1]

2. **Apply the "Reverse Burden of Proof" Principle:**
   * Remember that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, not with those questioning it.
   * Politely but firmly request specific evidence: "That's an interesting point. Could you share what evidence led you to that conclusion?" [Cite: 4.2]

3. **Look for Qualifiers and Nuance:**
   * Be skeptical of absolute statements that lack qualifiers like "sometimes," "may," "suggests," or "evidence indicates."
   * Recognize that genuine experts typically acknowledge limitations and degrees of certainty in their field. [Cite: 4.3]

4. **Counter Repetition with Varied Evaluation:**
   * Knowing that repeated exposure increases perceived truth, deliberately evaluate assertions from multiple angles each time you encounter them.
   * Ask different questions about the claim rather than simply reprocessing it in the same way. [Cite: 4.4]

5. **Seek Independent Verification:**
   * Consult multiple, independent sources on the topic, particularly those with different perspectives or incentives.
   * Look specifically for evidence that might contradict the assertion, not just confirmation. [Cite: 4.5]

6. **Practice "Steel-Manning" Alternative Views:**
   * Consider the strongest possible arguments against the assertion, even if the person making it hasn't addressed them.
   * Ask: "What would someone who disagrees with this claim say, and what evidence might they cite?" [Cite: 4.6]

7. **Identify Hidden Value Judgments:**
   * Distinguish between empirical claims (which can be verified with evidence) and value judgments (which reflect priorities and preferences).
   * Recognize when factual-sounding assertions actually contain embedded values or normative positions. [Cite: 4.7]
