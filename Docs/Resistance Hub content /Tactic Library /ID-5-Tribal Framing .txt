# Tactic Library: Tribal Framing / In-group Out-group

**(Tactic ID: 5)**

---

### **Tactic Detail View**

* **Clear Definition:** This tactic involves creating or emphasizing divisions between social groups, positioning one group (the "in-group") as superior, more virtuous, or more deserving than another (the "out-group"). It frames issues through a lens of group identity and loyalty rather than objective merits.
* **Core Mechanism:** It works by activating fundamental human tendencies toward group affiliation and social identity. By establishing clear boundaries between "us" and "them," it leverages our psychological need for belonging and our tendency to view our own groups positively while attributing negative characteristics to outsiders. This framing can bypass rational evaluation of ideas on their merits by recasting disagreements as matters of group loyalty or identity.

### **Intent Spectrum Explained**

* **Legitimate Use:**
    * **Description:** Fostering healthy community identity and cohesion based on shared positive values or goals. Acknowledging genuine group differences while maintaining respect for all parties. Building team spirit or solidarity without denigrating others.
    * **Example:** A sports coach building team unity by highlighting positive shared values and commitment to excellence. *"As members of this team, we've committed to supporting each other and working harder than our competitors. Let's show them our dedication to these principles on the field today."* [Cite: 1.1]

* **Borderline Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Exaggerating differences between groups while minimizing similarities. Selectively emphasizing negative traits of outgroups and positive traits of the ingroup. Framing complex issues primarily through group identity rather than substance. Creating implicit pressure to conform to group positions to maintain belonging.
    * **Example:** A political commentator suggesting that voters from opposing parties don't share fundamental American values. *"People like us understand what this country is really about. Those voters on the other side just don't appreciate traditional American values like we do. You're either with us in protecting our way of life, or you're with them."* [Cite: 1.2]

* **Blatant Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Dehumanizing or demonizing outgroups while idealizing the ingroup. Fabricating or grossly distorting characteristics of outgroups to inspire fear or hatred. Using group identity to silence dissent or critical thinking within the ingroup. Encouraging discrimination, exclusion, or hostility based on group membership.
    * **Example:** A radical ideologue characterizing members of different ethnic or religious groups as inherently dangerous and subhuman. *"Those people are not like us—they're fundamentally immoral and dangerous. They're infiltrating our communities to destroy our way of life. True loyalty means rejecting their influence completely. Anyone who defends them is a traitor to our cause."* [Cite: 1.3]

### **Common Scenarios**

* **Political Campaigns and Rhetoric:** Candidates emphasizing divisions between supporters and opponents, often positioning their base as the "real" Americans, patriots, or moral actors (e.g., "Hardworking Americans like you versus the coastal elites"). [Cite: 2.1]
* **Religious or Ideological Messaging:** Groups positioning themselves as uniquely enlightened, saved, or correct while portraying others as misguided, ignorant, or morally corrupt (e.g., "We are the defenders of truth in a world of deception"). [Cite: 2.2]
* **Media Coverage and Commentary:** News sources framing stories in ways that reinforce existing social divisions or stereotypes (e.g., coverage that consistently portrays certain communities primarily as problems or threats). [Cite: 2.3]
* **Marketing and Branding:** Products positioned as signals of belonging to desirable social groups (e.g., "People like us drive this kind of car"). [Cite: 2.4]
* **Workplace or Organizational Politics:** Creating divisions between departments, teams, or hierarchical levels (e.g., "Upper management doesn't understand what people on the front lines like us deal with").

### **Related Cognitive Biases**

* **Ingroup Bias:** The tendency to favor members of one's own group over those in other groups, giving them preferential treatment and evaluating them more positively. This makes us receptive to messages that flatter our own group. [Cite: 3.1]
* **Outgroup Homogeneity Effect:** The tendency to view members of outgroups as more similar to each other than members of one's own group, who are seen as more diverse. This facilitates stereotyping and oversimplification of "them." [Cite: 3.2]
* **Ultimate Attribution Error:** The tendency to attribute positive behaviors of ingroup members to their inherent qualities, while attributing the same behaviors in outgroup members to situational factors (and vice versa for negative behaviors). [Cite: 3.3]
* **Identity-Protective Cognition:** The tendency to selectively assess evidence in ways that support positions associated with valued social groups one belongs to, preserving one's sense of group identity. [Cite: 3.4]

### **"How to Spot It" Checklist**

* [_] Does the message rely heavily on pronouns like "we/us" versus "they/them" without clearly defining who these groups include?
* [_] Are complex issues simplified into a battle between clearly defined "good" and "bad" groups?
* [_] Does the message attribute uniformly positive traits to one group and negative traits to another?
* [_] Is there an implication that disagreeing with the message means betraying or leaving your group?
* [_] Does the message appeal to group loyalty rather than providing evidence or reasoning?
* [_] Are differences between groups emphasized while similarities are minimized or ignored?
* [_] Is your emotional reaction tied to your sense of group identity rather than to the substance of the argument?

### **Detailed Resistance Strategies**

1. **Practice Conscious Identity Awareness:**
   * Notice when your group identities (political, religious, professional, etc.) are being activated or appealed to in a message.
   * Ask yourself: "Would I feel differently about this argument if it came from someone outside my group or was directed at a different issue?" [Cite: 4.1]

2. **Look for Nuance and Within-Group Variation:**
   * Remind yourself that all groups contain significant internal diversity of thought, values, and behavior.
   * Challenge statements that attribute uniform characteristics to entire groups ("All X believe/do Y").
   * Seek out perspectives from members of the "outgroup" that contradict stereotypical portrayals. [Cite: 4.2]

3. **Separate Identity from Arguments:**
   * Evaluate ideas and arguments based on their merits rather than on who presents them or which group they're associated with.
   * Practice "idea blindfolding"—consider how you would evaluate the same argument if it came from a different source or applied to a different group. [Cite: 4.3]

4. **Find Common Ground:**
   * Look for shared values, goals, or experiences that span the supposed group divisions.
   * Consider how the issue might be framed in ways that unite rather than divide different communities.
   * Recall positive interactions with individuals from the "other" group that contradict tribal narratives. [Cite: 4.4]

5. **Question Motivations Behind Tribal Framing:**
   * Ask: "Who benefits from keeping these groups divided or in conflict?"
   * Consider whether tribal framing might be distracting from substantive discussion of the actual issue. [Cite: 4.5]

6. **Practice Intellectual Humility:**
   * Recognize that no group has a monopoly on truth or moral righteousness.
   * Be willing to acknowledge valid points or concerns raised by those outside your usual social or ideological circles.
   * Admit when your own group might be falling short of its stated ideals. [Cite: 4.6]

7. **Build Cross-Group Relationships:**
   * Develop genuine connections with individuals from groups portrayed as "other" or "them."
   * These relationships provide reality checks against simplified or demonized portrayals.
   * Personalized contact with outgroup members is one of the most effective ways to reduce prejudice and tribalism. [Cite: 4.7]
