# Tactic Library: Sealioning

**(Tactic ID: 12)**

---

### **Tactic Detail View**

* **Clear Definition:** This tactic involves harassing someone with persistent, disingenuous questions and requests for evidence under the guise of sincere curiosity or civil debate. The "sealioner" repeatedly demands explanations, sources, or proof while maintaining a facade of politeness, even as their target becomes frustrated or exhausted.
* **Core Mechanism:** It works by exploiting social norms around civility and evidence-based discussion. By framing unreasonable demands as reasonable requests for information, sealioning places targets in a no-win situation: either they exhaust themselves providing endless evidence that is never deemed sufficient, or they refuse to engage and appear unable to support their position. This shifts the burden of proof entirely to one party while draining their time and energy.

### **Intent Spectrum Explained**

* **Legitimate Use:**
    * **Description:** Sincerely asking clarifying questions to understand a position better. Respectfully requesting evidence for claims while being open to the response. Engaging in good-faith dialogue with genuine interest in the answers, while respecting reasonable boundaries around the other person's time and energy.
    * **Example:** A student asking a professor for sources to learn more about a complex topic, while respecting when enough information has been provided. *"Your point about climate feedback loops is interesting. Could you recommend one or two key studies I could read to understand this better? I'd appreciate any direction you can provide when you have time."* [Cite: 1.1]

* **Borderline Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Asking excessive follow-up questions without acknowledging previous answers. Requesting increasingly specific evidence without engaging meaningfully with what's already been provided. Continuing to press for explanations after reasonable responses have been given, while maintaining plausible deniability about intentions.
    * **Example:** A commenter repeatedly questioning established scientific consensus while ignoring explanations. *"But how do you know vaccines are safe? Can you provide peer-reviewed studies? But who funded those studies? How do you know those researchers aren't biased? Can you prove they weren't influenced? I'm just asking questions here."* [Cite: 1.2]

* **Blatant Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Deliberately overwhelming someone with questions and demands for evidence with no intention of accepting any response. Using the appearance of civility to mask harassment. Continuing to demand engagement after being explicitly asked to stop. Coordinating with others to target someone with relentless questioning.
    * **Example:** A group systematically targeting a public figure across platforms with endless demands for "just one more explanation." *"I've reviewed your 15-page explanation and extensive source list, but you still haven't adequately addressed my specific question about [minor detail]. I'm simply requesting clarification. Why are you refusing to engage with legitimate criticism? Your unwillingness to answer speaks volumes."* [Cite: 1.3]

### **Common Scenarios**

* **Social Media Discourse:** Users demanding extensive explanations for casual comments or statements, particularly on topics related to marginalized groups' experiences (e.g., "Can you provide scientific evidence for how exactly that comment was harmful?"). [Cite: 2.1]
* **Public Figure Interactions:** Individuals bombarding public figures, journalists, or experts with endless "just asking questions" that have already been answered elsewhere (e.g., repeated demands for a climate scientist to "explain" basic principles in every comment section). [Cite: 2.2]
* **Online Forums and Comment Sections:** Commenters derailing discussions by demanding that other participants educate them on basic concepts or provide exhaustive evidence for widely accepted information (e.g., "I'm going to need primary sources for each of your claims before this conversation can continue"). [Cite: 2.3]
* **Academic or Professional Settings:** Colleagues repeatedly questioning settled matters or policies with demands for justification, despite thorough previous explanations (e.g., "I still don't understand why we have this diversity policy. Could you explain it again with specific examples?"). [Cite: 2.4]
* **Political Discussions:** Demanding that advocates for social change personally justify each element of their position with scholarly sources in casual conversations (e.g., "If you can't immediately provide peer-reviewed evidence for how this specific policy would work, it's clearly not viable").

### **Related Cognitive Biases**

* **JAQing Off (Just Asking Questions):** A rhetorical technique where one poses leading questions to plant seeds of doubt without having to actually defend a position. Sealioning often employs this approach while maintaining a veneer of civility. [Cite: 3.1]
* **Cognitive Load Exploitation:** Taking advantage of the fact that responding to questions requires more cognitive resources than asking them. By overwhelming someone with questions, a sealioner can exhaust their target's mental capacity. [Cite: 3.2]
* **Moving the Goalposts:** The tendency to continually change the criteria of success after they have been met. Sealioners typically find any evidence insufficient, always requiring more or different proof. [Cite: 3.3]
* **False Consensus Effect:** The tendency to overestimate how much others agree with one's own beliefs. Sealioners often exploit this by suggesting their excessive questioning is what any reasonable person would expect, making targets doubt their own boundaries. [Cite: 3.4]

### **"How to Spot It" Checklist**

* [_] Are you facing a barrage of questions that continue even after you've provided reasonable responses?
* [_] Does the questioner maintain a tone of exaggerated politeness even as their behavior becomes intrusive?
* [_] Are you being asked to provide increasingly specific evidence or explanations without acknowledgment of what you've already shared?
* [_] Is the person demanding you educate them on basic concepts that they could easily research themselves?
* [_] Do they ignore or dismiss the sources you provide while demanding more?
* [_] Are they framing their persistent questioning as "just trying to understand" or "just asking questions"?
* [_] Do you feel exhausted by the interaction while the questioner seems energized to continue indefinitely?

### **Detailed Resistance Strategies**

1. **Set Clear Engagement Boundaries:**
   * Decide in advance how much time and energy you're willing to invest in the conversation.
   * Be explicit about your boundaries: "I can answer 1-2 more questions on this topic, then I need to move on." [Cite: 4.1]

2. **Recognize When Enough Is Enough:**
   * Be willing to disengage once you've provided reasonable responses that aren't being acknowledged.
   * Remember that you don't owe endless explanations to everyone who demands them, especially in casual or social settings. [Cite: 4.2]

3. **Redirect to Existing Resources:**
   * When appropriate, point to readily available sources rather than repeatedly explaining basic concepts.
   * "This information is widely available. I'd recommend starting with [specific source] if you're interested in learning more." [Cite: 4.3]

4. **Use the "Reverse Burden" Technique:**
   * Ask the questioner to explain why they find your previous answers insufficient.
   * "I've provided several explanations and sources. What specifically do you find unconvincing about them, and what would you consider adequate evidence?" [Cite: 4.4]

5. **Identify Pattern and Name It:**
   * When you recognize sealioning, naming the behavior can be powerful: "I notice we're in a pattern where regardless of what information I provide, it's never deemed sufficient."
   * This shifts focus from the content demands to the interaction pattern itself. [Cite: 4.5]

6. **Employ the "Final Offer" Approach:**
   * Provide one comprehensive, well-sourced response with the clear statement that it's your final word on the matter.
   * "This represents my complete position with supporting evidence. I won't be engaging further on this specific topic." [Cite: 4.6]

7. **Utilize Community Support:**
   * In online spaces, community guidelines or moderators can help address persistent sealioning.
   * Don't hesitate to use blocking or muting functions when someone refuses to respect your boundaries.
   * In public forums, sometimes other participants will recognize the pattern and intervene. [Cite: 4.7]
