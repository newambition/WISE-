    "definition": "Affirmation is a tactic that employs positive statements, praise, or enthusiastic endorsements to influence someone's attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors. Rather than using criticism or negative messaging, it works by creating positive associations and feelings that encourage acceptance of ideas, products, or people.",
    "core_mechanism": "It works by leveraging our natural responsiveness to positive reinforcement and validation. By creating positive emotional states through praise, encouragement, or enthusiastic statements, affirmation can lower critical thinking barriers and increase receptivity to persuasion. The good feeling generated by affirmation often transfers to the associated message, person, or product, increasing acceptance and creating a sense of connection or alignment with the affirmer.",

Making extravagant positive statements disconnected from reality.",
