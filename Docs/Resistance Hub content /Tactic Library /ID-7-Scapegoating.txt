# Tactic Library: Scapegoating

**(Tactic ID: 7)**

---

### **Tactic Detail View**

* **Clear Definition:** This tactic involves attributing complex problems, societal challenges, or personal failures to a specific person, group, or entity that is portrayed as primarily or solely responsible. The scapegoat becomes the target of blame, absolving others of responsibility and providing a simple explanation for complicated issues.
* **Core Mechanism:** It works by exploiting the human tendency to seek simple causes for complex problems and to externalize blame for negative outcomes. By channeling collective frustration, anxiety, or anger toward a defined target, scapegoating provides emotional relief and a sense of control while avoiding the difficulty of addressing multifaceted systemic issues or acknowledging shared responsibility.

### **Intent Spectrum Explained**

* **Legitimate Use:**
    * **Description:** Accurately identifying a specific actor's genuine responsibility for a problem based on clear evidence. Appropriately attributing causality where direct links exist. Holding powerful entities accountable for documented harms while acknowledging broader context.
    * **Example:** A regulatory agency identifying a corporation that has conclusively been shown to have knowingly violated safety standards, leading to specific documented harms. *"Our investigation has determined that Company X knowingly disregarded legally required safety protocols, which directly contributed to the accident. However, we also note that regulatory oversight should be strengthened."* [Cite: 1.1]

* **Borderline Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Oversimplifying complex problems by overemphasizing the role of one factor or group. Selectively highlighting certain causes while downplaying others that would distribute responsibility more widely. Appealing to existing prejudices or frustrations to make the scapegoating more compelling.
    * **Example:** A politician attributing a city's rising crime primarily to a specific immigrant community despite multiple contributing factors including poverty, reduced social services, and housing instability affecting many groups. *"Crime was under control until these people started moving into our neighborhoods. Now look what's happening to our once-safe streets."* [Cite: 1.2]

* **Blatant Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Falsely blaming vulnerable or marginalized groups for problems they have no significant connection to. Fabricating evidence or using conspiracy theories to target scapegoats. Deliberately inflaming prejudice or hatred to divert attention from actual causes or for political gain. Creating fictional threats to justify discrimination or violence.
    * **Example:** A leader blaming an ethnic or religious minority for economic problems caused by policy failures, global trends, or natural disasters. *"These people are the source of all our nation's troubles. They control everything behind the scenes and deliberately sabotage our economy. Every problem we face can be traced back to their influence."* [Cite: 1.3]

### **Common Scenarios**

* **Political Discourse:** Leaders or parties blaming specific groups (immigrants, elites, corporations, foreign countries) for complex economic or social problems (e.g., "Jobs are disappearing because Country X is stealing them"). [Cite: 2.1]
* **Organizational Failure:** Companies or institutions focusing blame on specific individuals rather than addressing systemic issues when failures occur (e.g., firing a mid-level manager for problems stemming from executive policies). [Cite: 2.2]
* **Economic Hardship:** Attributing economic downturns, inequality, or job losses to specific demographic groups rather than to broader economic trends, policies, or technological changes (e.g., blaming a minority group for "taking jobs"). [Cite: 2.3]
* **Social Problems:** Explaining complex social issues like crime, poverty, or public health crises by focusing primarily on the perceived flaws or actions of specific communities (e.g., attributing drug addiction solely to personal moral failings). [Cite: 2.4]
* **Historical Persecution:** Throughout history, minority groups have been scapegoated for societal problems, leading to discrimination and violence (e.g., blaming religious minorities for disease outbreaks or natural disasters).

### **Related Cognitive Biases**

* **Attribution Error:** The tendency to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while underemphasizing situational factors. This facilitates blaming individuals or groups rather than systems or circumstances. [Cite: 3.1]
* **Just-World Hypothesis:** The tendency to believe that the world is fundamentally fair, leading people to assume that victims of misfortune must have deserved their fate. This makes it easier to blame disadvantaged groups for their own struggles. [Cite: 3.2]
* **Cognitive Simplification:** The tendency to prefer simple, clear explanations over complex ones. Scapegoating offers straightforward narratives about causality that are easier to process than multifaceted systemic explanations. [Cite: 3.3]
* **Outgroup Homogeneity Bias:** The tendency to view members of outgroups as more similar to each other than members of one's own group. This facilitates attributing the same negative characteristics or intentions to an entire scapegoated group. [Cite: 3.4]

### **"How to Spot It" Checklist**

* [_] Does the explanation attribute complex problems to a single cause or group?
* [_] Is blame directed at a group that is already marginalized, disliked, or has limited power to defend itself?
* [_] Are the accused described in dehumanizing, absolute, or monolithic terms?
* [_] Does the explanation ignore systemic factors, historical context, or alternative causes?
* [_] Is there a clear emotional benefit (relief, superiority, unity) from accepting the scapegoating narrative?
* [_] Are specific mechanisms of causation explained, or is blame implied through association?
* [_] Does accepting the explanation absolve you or your ingroup from any responsibility?

### **Detailed Resistance Strategies**

1. **Recognize Pattern and Historical Context:**
   * Be aware that scapegoating follows predictable patterns across different contexts and historical periods.
   * Ask: "Has this group been blamed for similar problems before? Does this explanation resemble historical scapegoating that was later discredited?" [Cite: 4.1]

2. **Demand Specific Causal Mechanisms:**
   * When a group is blamed, ask for specific, step-by-step explanations of how exactly they caused the problem.
   * Vague accusations or associations without clear causal links often indicate scapegoating. [Cite: 4.2]

3. **Apply Systems Thinking:**
   * Recognize that most significant societal problems have multiple interconnected causes rather than single culprits.
   * Ask: "What systemic factors, policies, historical developments, or institutional practices might contribute to this situation?" [Cite: 4.3]

4. **Question Statistical Representation:**
   * When data is used to support scapegoating, examine whether it's being presented accurately and in proper context.
   * Look for cherry-picked statistics, misleading comparisons, or the absence of per capita adjustments. [Cite: 4.4]

5. **Humanize the Accused Group:**
   * Counteract dehumanization by seeking out diverse perspectives from within the blamed group.
   * Remember that complex motivations, internal diversity, and contextual factors exist in all human groups. [Cite: 4.5]

6. **Examine Power Dynamics:**
   * Consider whether blame is being directed downward toward groups with less power rather than toward those with more influence over the situation.
   * Ask: "Who has the actual authority or resources to have significantly caused or prevented this problem?" [Cite: 4.6]

7. **Practice Distributed Responsibility:**
   * Consider how responsibility might be appropriately distributed among multiple actors, including systems, institutions, and various groups (potentially including your own).
   * Look for solutions that address multiple contributing factors rather than simply removing or punishing a scapegoat. [Cite: 4.7]
