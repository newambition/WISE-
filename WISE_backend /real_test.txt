We are excited to share this insightful piece by Mays Al-Ali, a registered nutritionist & naturopath with a masters in clinical nutrition, specialising in gut health. Mays breaks down what a gut detox really entails. We know there is a lot of mis-information and extreme dieting when it comes to health so we are really pleased we are able to shed some light on how you can detox your gut naturally to optimise your health. 

How To Detox The Gut Naturally

In today's fast-paced world, our gut health is constantly under attack - from stress, processed foods, environmental toxins, and even poor sleep. If you’re feeling sluggish, bloated, or experiencing skin flare-ups and brain fog, your gut may be crying out for a reset. I'm here to talk to you about a natural, functional approach to gut detoxification.

As a nutritionist and gut health expert, I work holistically to support the body’s natural detoxification pathways. A proper gut detox isn’t only about complex fasting protocols (yes I do work with these with huge success) but it’s largely about what you do in the every day beyond, ie nourishment, balance, and optimising digestion with making the right choices to nourish your mind, body and soul. In this guide, I’ll walk you through the science-backed principles of a gut detox and how you can support your microbiome with real food, prebiotics, live cultures, and targeted nutrients.

Why Does Your Gut Need a Detox? 

Your gut is home to trillions of microbes that influence digestion, metabolism, immunity, and even mood. Research shows that imbalances in gut bacteria (dysbiosis) are linked to inflammation, digestive disorders, obesity, and even mental health conditions (Valdes et al., 2018). When the gut is overwhelmed with processed foods, sugar, alcohol, or stress, it can lead to imbalances such as:

Dysbiosis: An overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, candida/yeast, SIBO or parasites (Chassaing et al., 2017)
Leaky gut: A compromised gut lining leading to inflammation & immune dysfunction
Slow digestion: Constipation, bloating, and sluggish bowel movements
Toxin build-up: Poor elimination of waste products & mould, heavy metal toxicity
A natural gut detox helps your body cleanse itself by eliminating toxins while replenishing beneficial bacteria (Blaser, 2016). However, factors like chronic stress can alter gut microbiota composition (Foster et al., 2017), while poor sleep and lack of movement disrupt gut function (Benedict et al., 2012). Supporting your gut with the right lifestyle choices can make all the difference in maintaining a healthy, balanced microbiome.

A well-designed gut detox removes gut irritants, replenishes beneficial bacteria, and supports detoxification pathways - leading to improved digestion, energy, and immune function.

Step 1: Remove Gut Irritants

The first step in a functional gut detox is eliminating common inflammatory triggers. This isn’t about cutting calories or starving yourself; it’s about removing the substances that harm your gut lining and disrupt your microbiome.

Foods to reduce

Refined sugar & ultra processed foods – Feed harmful bacteria and yeast  & linked to dysbiosis and metabolic dysfunction (Suez et al., 2014)
Alcohol & caffeine – Disrupt gut motility and weaken the gut lining (Bishehsari et al., 2017)
Gluten & dairy – Potential gut irritants, especially if you have sensitivities (Lis et al., 2019)
Additives – Can disrupt the gut microbiome (Chassaing et al., 2015)
Instead, focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods that nourish the gut.

Step 2: Replenish with Gut-Healing Foods

Once you've removed inflammatory foods, it's time to nourish your gut with foods that promote healing and microbial diversity.

Gut-healing superfoods:

Biomel Gut Health Coconut Shots - Rich in live cultures and diverse fibres to replenish beneficial bacteria (Ouwehand et al., 2002)
Prebiotic fibre (chicory root, garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Biomel also do a delicious prebiotic cereal bar with 13 grams of fibre per bar!) - Feeds good bacteria to promote a thriving gut microbiome (Slavin, 2013)
Bone broth - Supports gut lining repair with collagen and amino acids such as glutamine(Kim et al., 2017)
Fermented foods (kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, kefir) - Contain live cultures that enhance gut health (Marco et al., 2017)
Dark leafy greens & cruciferous vegetables - Support detoxification pathways in the liver (Li et al., 2011)
Healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, seeds) - Reduce inflammation (Calder, 2015)

The role of prebiotics & live cultures

A successful gut detox isn’t just about removing toxins - it’s about rebalancing your microbiome. Prebiotics act as food for beneficial bacteria, while live cultures help to repopulate your gut with good microbes. Including both is essential for long-term gut health.

Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)

One of the most important healing metabolites produced by the gut are SCFA. These are produced when beneficial bacteria in the gut ferment prebiotic fibres such as resistant starches (from plant-based foods in our diet) within the colon resulting in metabolites like acetate, propionate, and butyrate; these SCFAs play a crucial role in maintaining gut health by providing energy to the colon lining cells, maintaining gut integrity, regulating immune response, and potentially reducing inflammation, contributing to overall metabolic health, blood sugar control & even weight management.

Step 3: Support Natural Detoxification

Your liver, kidneys, and colon work together to remove toxins from the body. Support their function with these natural strategies:

Hydration, sweating & herbal support

Drink plenty of filtered water - Helps flush out toxins. Add a bit of lemon to stimulate digestion & bile flow. (Popkin et al., 2010) (Hodges et al., 2015)
Dandelion & milk thistle tea - Supports liver detoxification (Kroll et al., 2007)
Open lymphatic drainage channels by sweating - Saunas and infra-red saunas especially are super healing for detox. When we sweat we release toxins so this is one of the best ways to detox. Add in dry skin brushing before or after for extra lymph stimulation and a lympathic drainage massage too!
Gut-Supportive Lifestyle Habits

Manage stress - Chronic stress disrupts digestion and gut health (Foster et al., 2017), working on down regulation practises such as yoga, meditation, breath work are key to balance things. Or attending a transformational wellness yoga and nutrition
retreat
which I host yearly in Ibiza – unmissable and amazing for healing the mind body and soul.
Move daily - Exercise promotes gut motility and circulation (Bressa et al., 2017).
Prioritize sleep - Deep sleep is crucial for gut repair and detoxification (Benedict et al., 2012).
Step 4: Reset Your Gut with a Guided Detox Program

If you’re serious about giving your gut a full reset, consider a structured gut detox protocol like Healthy Mays' online detox program. This program is designed to:

✔️ Reduce bloating and improve digestion
✔️ Enhance energy levels and mental clarity
✔️ Support gut lining repair and microbiome balance
✔️ Optimise detox pathways by detoxing mould, parasites, heavy metals & pathogenic bacteria.

And features a 10-day guided cleanse with group support designed to take part from the comfort of your own home, utilising my 3 step to remove toxins...

Fasting - When we fast, we break down fat as fuel. Toxins are stored in our fat cells, so we then release them into the blood and lymphatic system - if we don’t excrete them this can make us more sick!
Binders - We use binders like psyllium husk, bentonite clay, charcoal to bind to the toxins so they can be excreted from the body.
Enemas - We then use coffee enemas and colonics to excrete those toxins out of the body. Thi is why my tried and tested cleanse gets such incredible results as you release stored toxins from the body that have been there for decades. Recent clients have had autoimmune conditions reversed, cycles returning, reducing medications for anxiety/ADHD and so much more!
Step 5: Maintain Long-Term Gut Health

A gut detox is not just a one-time event, it’s a way of life. To keep your gut thriving long-term:

Eat a diverse range of plant-based foods to support microbial diversity (Zhang et al., 2010)
Incorporate fermented foods and probiotics regularly (Marco et al, 2017)
Limit processed foods, sugar, and alcohol (Chassaing et al., 2017)
Support stress resilience with mindfulness and self-care (Foster et al., 2017)
Final thoughts

A natural gut detox is about nourishment, not restriction. By removing inflammatory foods, replenishing with gut-healing nutrients, and supporting detox pathways, you can restore balance and vitality.

If you’re looking for a high-quality, functional food-based approach, consider incorporating Biomel’s Gut Health Shots and Complete Gut Powders into your daily routine to naturally support your gut.
